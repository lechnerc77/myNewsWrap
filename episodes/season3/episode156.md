# Episode 156: myNewsWrap – Microsoft, GitHub and SAP

Welcome to this week's edition of myNewsWrap, news from the world of Microsoft, GitHub, SAP ... and the world in between. The focus of my newsletter is the *application development* and all things around that can improve our lives as developers.

Let's dive into the news and explore what came up this week that can help us to build better solutions for our customers.

## Microsoft Universe

First we take a look at the Microsoft universe and what crossed my path there.

### Serverless - Functions, SWA and Azure Container Apps

Apps need to run somewhere and a very convenient way to run them is *serverless*. What came up this week in this space?

#### Azure Functions and Static Web Apps (SWA)

* [Migrating to v4 Azure Functions Node.js with TypeScript](https://johnnyreilly.com/migrating-azure-functions-node-js-v4-typescript) by John Reilly
* [Durable Entities support in the .NET isolated worker model is now in preview!](https://twitter.com/AzureFunctions/status/1717212584062194157?s=20)
* [Java on Azure Functions - 2023 Update](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/java-on-azure-functions-2023-update/ba-p/3958581?wt.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004195) by Sonia Kulkarni
* [This Month In Azure Static Web Apps | October 2023](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/this-month-in-azure-static-web-apps-october-2023/ba-p/3965142?wt.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004195) by Thomas Gauvin
* [Azure Static Web Apps Community Standup - Announcing Traffic Splitting and Snippets](https://www.youtube.com/live/mSqT9xwMREs?si=swCbibIKPJ56MIZh)

Although coined to AWS, a lot of stuff can be transfered to Azure: [Save money on Serverless: common costly mistakes and how to avoid them](https://lumigo.io/blog/save-money-on-serverless-common-costly-mistakes-and-how-to-avoid-them/) by Yan Cui

#### Azure Container Apps

No news on Azure Container Apps crossed my path this week.

### Dapr

Having containers is nice but everything (well ... nearly everything 😉) gets better with [Dapr](https://dapr.io/) as an outstanding tool for app development in the container-based area. No news in this area for this week

### Developer Platform

This section collects all news touching the topic of a *developer platform*. Fuzzy term but here you find news on topics that make the life of developers easier beyond pure development be it *Infrastructure as Code*, *GitHub* and more like the [Azure Developer CLI](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev).  

#### Infrastructure as Code

How could I miss this great YT channel [Azure Terraformer](https://www.youtube.com/@azure-terraformer) by Mark Tinderholt? Subscription recommended!

#### GitHub

GitHub comes with a blast of new features and enhancements every week. Here are my top 5 news from GitHub that you should check out:

* [Developers are the first group to adopt AI at work. Here’s why that matters.](https://github.blog/2023-10-27-developers-are-the-first-group-to-adopt-ai-at-work-heres-why-that-matters/) by Kyle Daigle

#### Azure Developer CLI

Close to my heart as essence of how to make the developer life easier is the [Azure Developer CLI](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev). What's up in this area?

* New release [1.4.3](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/releases/tag/azure-dev-cli_1.4.3) ... x.x.3 release, is Ignite looking around the corner?

### The best of the "rest"

No matter how the structure of this newsletter is crafted, there is always something that does not perfectly fit. This section is dedicated to topics that I think are worth reading but did not fit into the structure from above:

* [My annual letter: Leading in a new era](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/my-annual-letter-leading-new-era-satya-nadella/) by Satya Nadella

Quite some articles around project Radius landed this week ... one is tempted to say that this project has quite some blast radius ;-)

* [Microsoft Reimagines Modern Application Deployment With Radius Platform](https://www.forbes.com/sites/janakirammsv/2023/10/23/microsoft-reimagines-modern-application-deployment-with-radius-platform/?sh=6799f5d976d7) by Janakiram MSV

## 🐱‍👤 SAP and Microsoft - Combining both worlds

Combining Microsoft with SAP can lead to incredible new applications. Let's enter the *twilight zone* (no worries the ninja cat is with us) between SAP and Microsoft and see what's up here:

* [SAP on Azure Video Podcast #165 - The one with Configuration Editor with SDAF (Kimmo Forss & Hemanth Damecharla)](https://youtu.be/RwSMUcUU_fk?si=TPXaSxVufbgrxHcl)

One important (and imho best part) of the job of a developer is the *continuous learning*. Here are some interesting learning resources that go beyond vendor-specific technology:
