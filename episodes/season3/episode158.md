# Episode 158: myNewsWrap – Microsoft, GitHub and SAP

Welcome to this week's edition of myNewsWrap, news from the world of Microsoft, GitHub, SAP ... and the world in between. The focus of my newsletter is the *application development* and all things around that can improve our lives as developers.

Let's dive into the news and explore what came up this week that can help us to build better solutions for our customers.

## Microsoft Universe

First we take a look at the Microsoft universe and what crossed my path there.

### Serverless - Functions, SWA and Azure Container Apps

No news this week ... is this the silence before the Microsoft Ignite storm?

### Dapr

Having containers is nice but everything (well ... nearly everything 😉) gets better with [Dapr](https://dapr.io/) as an outstanding tool for app development in the container-based area. Here we go what might be worth a look:

* [Announcing Diagrid Catalyst](https://www.diagrid.io/blog/announcing-diagrid-catalyst)

### Developer Platform

This section collects all news touching the topic of a *developer platform*. Fuzzy term but here you find news on topics that make the life of developers easier beyond pure development be it *Infrastructure as Code*, *GitHub* and more like the [Azure Developer CLI](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev).  

#### Infrastructure as Code

* [Getting to understand Azure Bicep Parameters](https://www.iamachs.com/p/getting-to-understand-azure-bicep-parameters) by Ahmed Muhi

#### GitHub

This week it is al about GitHub Universe - first the main recordings worth to watch 

* [GitHub Universe 2023 opening keynote](https://youtu.be/NrQkdDVupQE?si=4zTdfa4O9rQ-UUIY)
* [GitHub Universe 2023 day 2 keynote: The productivity platform for all developers](https://youtu.be/h_o9kFPVeiw?si=bbhr8yTNcC91zcjW)
* [AI: Superhero or super villain?](https://youtu.be/1TlI8lduPTE?si=hGCiPzcNKPcLYaoA) by Scott Hanselman

and here a bunch of blog posts

* [Universe 2023: Copilot transforms GitHub into the AI-powered developer platform](https://github.blog/2023-11-08-universe-2023-copilot-transforms-github-into-the-ai-powered-developer-platform/) by Thomas Dohmke
* [Leveraging AI to empower all developers at GitHub Universe 2023](https://github.blog/2023-11-02-leveraging-ai-to-empower-all-developers-at-github-universe-2023/) by Ed Summers

> Want to see all news around GitHub? I recommend to have a look at GitHub's [blog site](https://github.blog/) as well as at its [change log](https://github.blog/changelog/) to get the complete overview.

#### Azure Developer CLI

Close to my heart as essence of how to make the developer life easier is the [Azure Developer CLI](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev). What's up in this area?

* [Quickly build and deploy OpenAI apps on Azure, infused with your own data](https://youtu.be/j8i-OM5kwiY?si=rGdiPUWIvteITDRH) by the usual suspects :-)

### The best of the "rest"

No matter how the structure of this newsletter is crafted, there is always something that does not perfectly fit. This section is dedicated to topics that I think are worth reading but did not fit into the structure from above:

* [OpenAI DevDay, Opening Keynote](https://www.youtube.com/live/U9mJuUkhUzk?si=puqH_CL2DnJTSCWV) - also check out the [blog post](https://openai.com/blog/new-models-and-developer-products-announced-at-devday)
* [Open at Microsoft: Radius](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-developer-community-blog/open-at-microsoft-radius/ba-p/3975237?wt.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004195)
* [Building Carbon Awareness with KEDA - KubeConNA 2023 Demo](https://github.com/Azure/carbon-aware-keda-operator/blob/main/demo/kubecon.md)
* [GA: Kubernetes Event-driven Autoscaling (KEDA) Add-on for AKS](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/ga-kubernetes-eventdriven-autoscaling-keda-addon-for-aks/?wt.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004195)

## 🐱‍👤 SAP and Microsoft - Combining both worlds

Combining Microsoft with SAP can lead to incredible new applications. Let's enter the *twilight zone* (no worries the ninja cat is with us) between SAP and Microsoft and see what's up here:

* [SAP on Azure Video Podcast #167 - The one with Gen AI with SAP CAP (David Kunz)](https://youtu.be/nPym9uiPH-U?si=sgK6lCDYcUqUSy3R)

> And of course a channel that you should subscribe to if you are working with SAP and Microsoft is the [SAP on Azure](https://www.youtube.com/@SAPonAzure) hosted by [Holger Bruchelt](https://www.linkedin.com/in/holger-bruchelt/) and friends.

## Learning

One important (and imho best part) of the job of a developer is the *continuous learning*. Here are some interesting learning resources that go beyond vendor-specific technology:

* Interesting read: [Towards Modern Development of Cloud Applications](https://sigops.org/s/conferences/hotos/2023/papers/ghemawat.pdf) by Sanjay Ghemawat, Robert Grandl, Srdjan Petrovic, Michael Whittaker, Parveen Patel, Ivan Posva, Amin Vahdat (Google)

### Golo's Corner

One great resource for becoming a better developer and reflecting about our profession is the high-quality content of [the native web GmbH](https://thenativeweb.io/) by [Golo Roden](https://twitter.com/goloroden). This week the following topics were on the list:
