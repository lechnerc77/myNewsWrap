# Episode 157: myNewsWrap ‚Äì Microsoft, GitHub and SAP

Welcome to this week's edition of myNewsWrap, news from the world of Microsoft, GitHub, SAP ... and the world in between. The focus of my newsletter is the *application development* and all things around that can improve our lives as developers.

Let's dive into the news and explore what came up this week that can help us to build better solutions for our customers.

## Microsoft Universe

First we take a look at the Microsoft universe and what crossed my path there.

### Serverless - Functions, SWA and Azure Container Apps

Apps need to run somewhere and a very convenient way to run them is *serverless*. What came up this week in this space?

#### Azure Functions and Static Web Apps (SWA)

* [Public preview launch of Dapr extension for Azure Functions](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/public-preview-launch-of-dapr-extension-for-azure-functions/ba-p/3966398?wt.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004195) by Ramya Oruganti
* [GA: Performance optimizations for the isolated worker model in .NET Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/ga-performance-optimizations-for-the-isolated-worker-model-in-net-azure-functions/?wt.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004195)
* [GA: Service Bus message settlement in isolated worker model for .NET Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/ga-service-bus-message-settlement-in-isolated-worker-model-for-net-azure-functions/?wt.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004195)
* [Recoverability with Azure Functions](https://weblogs.asp.net/sfeldman/recoverability-with-azure-functions) by 
* [Recoverability with Azure Functions - Delayed Retries](https://asp-blogs.azurewebsites.net/sfeldman/recoverability-with-azure-functions-delayed-retries) by 

#### Azure Container Apps

Quite quiet around in the Azure Container Apps space at the moment ...

### Dapr

Having containers is nice but everything (well ... nearly everything üòâ) gets better with [Dapr](https://dapr.io/) as an outstanding tool for app development in the container-based area. Here we go what might be worth a look:

* [Dapr Community Call - Nov 1st (#93)](https://youtu.be/h2PpB8JI67g?si=kqV6aXI4fTfwrR_F)
* [Choreography, or Orchestration, That is the Wrong Question](https://www.diagrid.io/blog/choreography-or-orchestration-that-is-the-wrong-question) by Bilgin Ibryam

### Developer Platform

This section collects all news touching the topic of a *developer platform*. Fuzzy term but here you find news on topics that make the life of developers easier beyond pure development be it *Infrastructure as Code*, *GitHub* and more like the [Azure Developer CLI](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev).  

#### Infrastructure as Code

* [Navigating the Future of Terraform and OpenTofu](https://thenewstack.io/navigating-the-future-of-terraform-and-opentofu/) by David Williams

#### GitHub

GitHub comes with a blast of new features and enhancements every week. Here are my top 5 news from GitHub that you should check out:

* [Demystifying LLMs: How they can do things they weren‚Äôt trained to do](https://github.blog/2023-10-27-demystifying-llms-how-they-can-do-things-they-werent-trained-to-do/) by Jeimy Ruiz
* [The architecture of today‚Äôs LLM applications](https://github.blog/2023-10-30-the-architecture-of-todays-llm-applications/) by Nicole Choi
* [Introducing the GitHub transparency center](https://github.blog/2023-10-31-introducing-the-github-transparency-center/) by Margaret Tucker
* [Copilot in GitHub Support (Beta)](https://github.blog/changelog/2023-10-31-copilot-in-github-support-beta/)
* [Azure private networking for GitHub-hosted runners ‚Äì Public Beta](https://github.blog/changelog/2023-11-01-github-hosted-runners-private-networking-with-azure-virtual-networks-public-beta/)

> Want to see all news around GitHub? I recommend to have a look at GitHub's [blog site](https://github.blog/) as well as at its [change log](https://github.blog/changelog/) to get the complete overview.

#### Azure Developer CLI

Close to my heart as essence of how to make the developer life easier is the [Azure Developer CLI](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev). What's up in this area?

* Nice sample of combining Terraform for SAP BTP with the Azure Developer CLI: [XP160 - Using Terraform for Cross-Cloud Setup of SAP BTP and Microsoft Azure](https://github.com/SAP-samples/teched2023-XP160)

### The best of the "rest"

No matter how the structure of this newsletter is crafted, there is always something that does not perfectly fit. This section is dedicated to topics that I think are worth reading but did not fit into the structure from above:

* Talk about Radius at the [LF Member Summit 2023 - Keynotes - Live from Monterey, California](https://www.youtube.com/live/kuRyYJaXThY?si=f_dnl-aN2EqrKRIY&t=3468) by Mark Russinovich et al.
* First [Radius Community Call - 2023/11/02](https://youtu.be/EfGAwli5W4U?si=qbeRXzznjnj_Q4Wd)

## üê±‚Äçüë§ SAP and Microsoft - Combining both worlds

Combining Microsoft with SAP can lead to incredible new applications. Let's enter the *twilight zone* (no worries the ninja cat is with us) between SAP and Microsoft and see what's up here:

* [SAP on Azure Video Podcast #166 - The one with updates on Premium v2 storage (Peter Kalan, Anbu Govindasamy)](https://youtu.be/rOcLkvpcmh4?si=KdfOANLzf30rCpbq)

> And of course a channel that you should subscribe to if you are working with SAP and Microsoft is the [SAP on Azure](https://www.youtube.com/@SAPonAzure) hosted by [Holger Bruchelt](https://www.linkedin.com/in/holger-bruchelt/) and friends.

## Learning

One important (and imho best part) of the job of a developer is the *continuous learning*. Here are some interesting learning resources that go beyond vendor-specific technology:

* Interesting case study - [Treezor: a serverless banking platform](https://bref.sh/docs/case-studies/treezor)

* [Node.js 21: Besser als gedacht?! // deutsch](https://youtu.be/bbwbCrjLobc?si=SUZ7ue6n3jj5QYol)
