# Episode 152: myNewsWrap ‚Äì Microsoft, GitHub and SAP

Welcome to this week's edition of myNewsWrap, news from the world of Microsoft, GitHub, SAP ... and the world in between. The focus of my newsletter is the *application development* and all things around that can improve our lives as developers.

Let's dive into the news and explore what came up this week that can help us to build better solutions for our customers.

## Microsoft Universe

First we take a look at the Microsoft universe and what crossed my path there.

### Serverless - Functions, SWA and Azure Container Apps

Apps need to run somewhere and a very convenient way to run them is *serverless*. What came up this week in this space?

#### Azure Functions and Static Web Apps (SWA)

* [Azure Functions Newsletter ‚Äì September 2023](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/azure-functions-newsletter-september-2023/ba-p/3930787?wt.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004195) by Thiago Almeida
* [Azure Functions: Node.js v4 programming model is Generally Available](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/azure-functions-node-js-v4-programming-model-is-generally/ba-p/3929217?wt.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004195) by Madhura Bharadwaj
* [Public preview: Azure Functions extension for Dapr](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/public-preview-azure-functions-extension-for-dapr/?wt.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004195)
* [GA: Support for Python 3.11 in Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/ga-support-for-python-311-in-azure-functions/?wt.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004195)
* Windows Apps Support - [Preview .NET versions](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/dotnet-isolated-process-guide#preview-net-versions?wt.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004195)

### Dapr

Having containers is nice but everything (well ... nearly everything üòâ) gets better with [Dapr](https://dapr.io/) as an outstanding tool for app development in the container-based area. Here we go what might be worth a look:

* [KubeCon Shanghai 2023](https://www.salaboy.com/2023/09/29/kubecon-shanghai-2023/) by Mauricio Salatino
* [Cloud-Native Microservices, on-premises oder in der Cloud ‚Äì mit Dapr](https://www.thinktecture.com/contributions/cloud-native-microservices-on-premises-oder-in-der-cloud-mit-dapr-2/) by Christian Weyer

### Developer Platform

This section collects all news touching the topic of a *developer platform*. Fuzzy term but here you find news on topics that make the life of developers easier beyond pure development be it *Infrastructure as Code*, *GitHub* and more like the [Azure Developer CLI](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev).  

#### Infrastructure as Code

* [Azure Verified Modules](https://azure.github.io/Azure-Verified-Modules/)
* [Why should I care about OpenTofu?](https://opentofu.org/blog/why-should-i-care-about-opentofu/) by Marcin Wyszynski

#### GitHub

GitHub comes with a blast of new features and enhancements every week. Here are my top 5 news from GitHub that you should check out:

* [GitHub Issues & Projects ‚Äì September 28th update](https://github.blog/changelog/2023-09-28-github-issues-projects-september-28th-update/)
* [How GitHub uses GitHub Actions and Actions larger runners to build and test GitHub.com](https://github.blog/2023-09-26-how-github-uses-github-actions-and-actions-larger-runners-to-build-and-test-github-com/) by Max Wagner

### The best of the "rest"

No matter how the structure of this newsletter is crafted, there is always something that does not perfectly fit. This section is dedicated to topics that I think are worth reading but did not fit into the structure from above:

* Azure [Enterprise-grade Reference Architecture for JavaScript](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/contoso-real-estate)
* [Build real-time apps with Azure Web PubSub for Socket.IO | Azure Friday](https://youtu.be/Ittmn6WsTRk?si=gt9mVJmPMpiEzngW) by by Kevin Guo and Chenyang Liu hosted by Scott Hanselman
* [New experiences designed to make every developer more productive on Windows 11](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2023/09/26/new-experiences-designed-to-make-every-developer-more-productive-on-windows-11/) by Mike Harsh

## üê±‚Äçüë§ SAP and Microsoft - Combining both worlds

Combining Microsoft with SAP can lead to incredible new applications. Let's enter the *twilight zone* (no worries the ninja cat is with us) between SAP and Microsoft and see what's up here:

* [SAP on Azure Video Podcast #162 - The one with Developing with the AI SDK for SAP (Gopal Nair) ](https://youtu.be/emUAVLy9R_0?si=51M-rECbnKmstQdQ)

> And of course a channel that you should subscribe to if you are working with SAP and Microsoft is the [SAP on Azure](https://www.youtube.com/@SAPonAzure) hosted by [Holger Bruchelt](https://www.linkedin.com/in/holger-bruchelt/) and friends.

### Further news from the SAP world

Let's check out what else happened in the SAP universe that you should check out:

* [DSAG-Positionspapier: K√ºnstliche Intelligenz (KI)](https://dsag.de/neuigkeiten/dsag-positionspapier-kuenstliche-intelligenz-ki/)

## Learning

One important (and imho best part) of the job of a developer is the *continuous learning*. Here are some interesting learning resources that go beyond vendor-specific technology:

* [Cloud-Native-all-the-Things: Definition, Praktiken und Patterns](https://www.thinktecture.com/contributions/cloud-native-all-the-things-definition-praktiken-und-patterns-2/) by Christian Weyer and Thorsten Hans

And here something highly appreciated from the sustainability area:

* [Video Serie: Cloud Native & Sustainability](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1U4Sf0SgnQ2006WcqXurBVMeKHdgzcGB) by Nico Meisenzahl. Stay tuned, more to come

### Golo's Corner

One great resource for becoming a better developer and reflecting about our profession is the high-quality content of [the native web GmbH](https://thenativeweb.io/) by [Golo Roden](https://twitter.com/goloroden). This week the following topics were on the list:

* [So verarschen Dich Unternehmen bei der Bewerbung // deutsch](https://youtu.be/TBfB-k4if38?si=wIGpbE2YC07Op1fM)

And Golo's personal channel with a new series - not IT, but about an important topic that is not too much talk about in the IT world:

* [Wenn alles schiefl√§uft ‚Ä¶ (wie Du mit R√ºckschl√§gen umgehst) // deutsch](https://youtu.be/DX1-wHKAmus?si=j_7rybpRzQKhCMa7)
