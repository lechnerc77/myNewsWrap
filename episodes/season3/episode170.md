# Episode 170: myNewsWrap – Microsoft, GitHub and SAP

Welcome to the **last** episode of myNewsWrap, news from the world of Microsoft, GitHub, SAP ... and the world in between. The focus of my newsletter is the *application development* and all things around that can improve our lives as developers.

Let's dive into the news and explore what came up this week that can help us to build better solutions for our customers.

## Microsoft Universe

First we take a look at the Microsoft universe and what crossed my path there.

### Serverless - Functions, SWA and Azure Container Apps

Apps need to run somewhere and a very convenient way to run them is *serverless*. What came up this week in this space?

#### Azure Functions and Static Web Apps (SWA)

* [Azure Functions Community Standup - Azure Functions latest updates + sneak peak!](https://www.youtube.com/live/44P8C2_EW_c?si=iKyxcg7VbTSZD5Yk)
* [Azure Functions bindings for OpenAI's GPT engine](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-openai-extension)

And something from teh AWS side which is quite impressing: [LLRT (Low Latency Runtime)](https://github.com/awslabs/llrt) for Serverless JavaScript applications.

### Dapr

Having containers is nice but everything (well ... nearly everything 😉) gets better with [Dapr](https://dapr.io/) as an outstanding tool for app development in the container-based area. Here we go what might be worth a look:

* Session recordings of [Dapr Days 2024](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcip_LgkYwzvXxnvC4r1dax2ro-_OrpPy)

### Developer Platform

This section collects all news touching the topic of a *developer platform*. Fuzzy term but here you find news on topics that make the life of developers easier beyond pure development be it *Infrastructure as Code*, *GitHub* and more like the [Azure Developer CLI](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev).  

#### Infrastructure as Code

* [Introducing Azure Verified Modules for Terraform](https://youtu.be/6OeRByC-sBs?si=0t1JLKpMK95y-_Q0) by Ned Bellavance and Matt White
* CTRL ALT AZURE: [Episode 226 - Azure Verified Modules with Jack Tracey](https://ctrlaltazure.com/episodes/226-azure-verified-modules-with-jack-tracey) with Kack Tracey
* [Symphony](https://github.com/microsoft/symphony)
* [Modularisierte Infrastructure-as-Code in Terraform](https://www.heise.de/hintergrund/Modularisierte-Infrastructure-as-Code-in-Terraform-9629194.html) by Steffen Hupp and Christoph Müller

#### GitHub

GitHub comes with a blast of new features and enhancements every week. Here are my top 3 news from GitHub that you should check out:

* 90 Days of DevOps: [Day 30 - How GitHub delivers GitHub using GitHub](https://youtu.be/wKC1hTE9G90?si=V3NWo6995uAO0g48) by April Edwards 
* [How AI code generation works](https://github.blog/2024-02-22-how-ai-code-generation-works/) by Jeimy Ruiz
* [How to stay safe from repo-jacking](https://github.blog/2024-02-21-how-to-stay-safe-from-repo-jacking/) by Kevin Backhouse

> Want to see all news around GitHub? I recommend to have a look at GitHub's [blog site](https://github.blog/) as well as at its [change log](https://github.blog/changelog/) to get the complete overview.

### The best of the "rest"

No matter how the structure of this newsletter is crafted, there is always something that does not perfectly fit. This section is dedicated to topics that I think are worth reading but did not fit into the structure from above:

* [Radius Community Call - 2024/02/22](https://youtu.be/9UpTgZS1H0E?si=lUvtmWgafi1se6Jk)
* [Advancing Microsoft Azure resilience with Chaos Studio](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/advancing-microsoft-azure-resilience-with-chaos-studio/)

And a bit af AI:

* Reference Repo: [Build & Modernize AI Applications](https://github.com/Azure/Build-Modern-AI-Apps)
* As there is often talk about Business AI: [Microsoft Project Sophia](https://adoption.microsoft.com/project-sophia/) - an example even I understand :-)

## 🐱‍👤 SAP and Microsoft - Combining both worlds

Combining Microsoft with SAP can lead to incredible new applications. Let's enter the *twilight zone* (no worries the ninja cat is with us) between SAP and Microsoft and see what's up here:

* [SAP on Azure Video Podcast #180 - The one with ACSS and Quality Checks (Kalyani Namuduri & Sagar Keswani)](https://youtu.be/AxWgn1yK7Fc?si=R9xSletLnvaaetvo)

> And of course a channel that you should subscribe to if you are working with SAP and Microsoft is the [SAP on Azure](https://www.youtube.com/@SAPonAzure) hosted by [Holger Bruchelt](https://www.linkedin.com/in/holger-bruchelt/) and friends.

## Learning

One important (and imho best part) of the job of a developer is the *continuous learning*. Here are some interesting learning resources that go beyond vendor-specific technology:

* [Generative AI Design Patterns: A Comprehensive Guide](https://towardsdatascience.com/generative-ai-design-patterns-a-comprehensive-guide-41425a40d7d0) by Vincent Koc

### Golo's Corner

One great resource for becoming a better developer and reflecting about our profession is the high-quality content of [the native web GmbH](https://thenativeweb.io/) by [Golo Roden](https://twitter.com/goloroden). This week the following topics were on the list:

* [API-Patterns: Shared Kernel, Anti-Corruption Layer & Co. – wie bitte?! // deutsch](https://youtu.be/n47RSfeFIy8?si=OSZzJjhfFybw5XeQ)
* [Apple macht unsere App kaputt // deutsch](https://youtu.be/ltb2PrClWWI?si=sS7t2-eNI6GSa5UQ)
