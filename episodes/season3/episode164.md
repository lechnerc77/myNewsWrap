# Episode 164: myNewsWrap – Microsoft, GitHub and SAP

Welcome to this week's edition of myNewsWrap, news from the world of Microsoft, GitHub, SAP ... and the world in between. The focus of my newsletter is the *application development* and all things around that can improve our lives as developers.

Let's dive into the news and explore what came up this week that can help us to build better solutions for our customers.

## Microsoft Universe

First we take a look at the Microsoft universe and what crossed my path there.

### Serverless - Functions, SWA and Azure Container Apps

Apps need to run somewhere and a very convenient way to run them is *serverless*. What came up this week in this space ... unfortunately nothing, but the year has just started 😉

### Dapr

Having containers is nice but everything (well ... nearly everything 😉) gets better with [Dapr](https://dapr.io/) as an outstanding tool for app development in the container-based area. Here we go what might be worth a look:

* [Dapr Community Call - Jan 10th (#96)](https://youtu.be/4gT0Y6QxinU?si=3Ez8FajSyRktsST7)

### Developer Platform

This section collects all news touching the topic of a *developer platform*. Fuzzy term but here you find news on topics that make the life of developers easier beyond pure development be it *Infrastructure as Code*, *GitHub* and more like the [Azure Developer CLI](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev).  

#### Infrastructure as Code

* [OpenTofu is going GA](https://opentofu.org/blog/opentofu-is-going-ga) by Kuba Martin
* [Reusability with export and import in Azure Bicep](https://johnlokerse.dev/2024/01/08/reusability-with-export-and-import-in-azure-bicep/) by John Lokerse
* [Displaying Terraform Plans in GitHub PRs with GitHub Actions](https://thomasthornton.cloud/2024/01/11/displaying-terraform-plans-in-github-prs-with-github-actions/) by Thomas Thornton

#### GitHub

GitHub comes with a blast of new features and enhancements every week. Here are my top 5 news from GitHub that you should check out:

* [5 ways to make your DevSecOps strategy developer-friendly](https://github.blog/2024-01-05-5-ways-to-make-your-devsecops-strategy-developer-friendly/) by Nick Liffen
* [Frenemies to friends: Developers and security tools](https://github.blog/2024-01-08-frenemies-to-friends-developers-and-security-tools/) by Shelby Gluck

> Want to see all news around GitHub? I recommend to have a look at GitHub's [blog site](https://github.blog/) as well as at its [change log](https://github.blog/changelog/) to get the complete overview.

#### Azure Developer CLI

Close to my heart as essence of how to make the developer life easier is the [Azure Developer CLI](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev). What's up in this area?

* New release of Radius: [v0.29.0](https://github.com/radius-project/radius/releases/tag/v0.29.0)
* [Azure OpenAI Proxy Service](https://microsoft.github.io/azure-openai-service-proxy/)

### The best of the "rest"

No matter how the structure of this newsletter is crafted, there is always something that does not perfectly fit. This section is dedicated to topics that I think are worth reading but did not fit into the structure from above:

## 🐱‍👤 SAP and Microsoft - Combining both worlds

Combining Microsoft with SAP can lead to incredible new applications. Let's enter the *twilight zone* (no worries the ninja cat is with us) between SAP and Microsoft and see what's up here:
