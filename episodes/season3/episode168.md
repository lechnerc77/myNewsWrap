# Episode 168: myNewsWrap ‚Äì Microsoft, GitHub and SAP

Welcome to this week's edition of myNewsWrap, news from the world of Microsoft, GitHub, SAP ... and the world in between. The focus of my newsletter is the *application development* and all things around that can improve our lives as developers.

Let's dive into the news and explore what came up this week that can help us to build better solutions for our customers.

## Microsoft Universe

First we take a look at the Microsoft universe and what crossed my path there.

### Serverless - Functions, SWA and Azure Container Apps

Apps need to run somewhere and a very convenient way to run them is *serverless*. What came up this week in this space?

#### Azure Container Apps

* [From Chaos to Clarity: Simplifying Your Networking with Azure Container Apps](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/startups-at-microsoft/from-chaos-to-clarity-simplifying-your-networking-with-azure/ba-p/4034625) by Rohit Turambekar
* [Choosing the Right Azure Container Solution for Your Application](https://www.iamachs.com/p/choosing-the-right-azure-container-solution-for-your-application) by Ahmed Muhi

### Dapr

Having containers is nice but everything (well ... nearly everything üòâ) gets better with [Dapr](https://dapr.io/) as an outstanding tool for app development in the container-based area. Here we go what might be worth a look:

* [Dapr Community Call - Feb 7th (#98)](https://youtu.be/-B7hDJlhXhk?si=T2WrKoenuO93skSq)
* [Azure Community Enthusiasts 5th February 2024 Event - Dapr](https://www.youtube.com/live/vV9R3owCdcQ?si=6WVLnaFbBZHi5KV5&t=228) with Marc Duiker

### Developer Platform

This section collects all news touching the topic of a *developer platform*. Fuzzy term but here you find news on topics that make the life of developers easier beyond pure development be it *Infrastructure as Code*, *GitHub* and more like the [Azure Developer CLI](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev).  

#### Infrastructure as Code

* [Bicep Community Call - January '24](https://youtu.be/Ng9rPvTCgDs?si=pXV9FcVbfzyUXUUh) - v0.25 Release!
* [Commit to Control: GitOps & Policy-as-Code using Azure Policy and Terraform](https://youtu.be/LsOhIXusIxg?si=oQbOBBzXWYx5kshW)
* [Terraform and the Art of Small: My Guide to Navigating Smarter, Safer State Management](https://medium.com/@orellanaluke/terraform-and-the-art-of-small-my-guide-to-navigating-smarter-safer-state-management-cd156533ccf7) by Orellanaluke

#### GitHub

GitHub comes with a blast of new features and enhancements every week. Here are my top 5 news from GitHub that you should check out:

* [GitHub Repository Best Practices](https://dev.to/pwd9000/github-repository-best-practices-23ck) by Marcel Lupo

#### Azure Developer CLI

Sad start into the year for azd friends ... no news, no community meeting :-(

### The best of the "rest"

No matter how the structure of this newsletter is crafted, there is always something that does not perfectly fit. This section is dedicated to topics that I think are worth reading but did not fit into the structure from above:

* [Introduction to Radius](https://www.youtube.com/live/2TogDyJHHJs?si=B2W-ZRv1I4REUiBO) by Will Velida
  * and also at the [Azure Community Enthusiasts 5th February 2024 Event](https://www.youtube.com/live/vV9R3owCdcQ?si=KsYbM8Ql0slrVOId&t=3742)
* [Hands-on with Backstage on Azure: From App Service to Azure DevOps](https://dirien.github.io/pulumi-backstage-azure-workshop/) by Engin Diri

## üê±‚Äçüë§ SAP and Microsoft - Combining both worlds

Combining Microsoft with SAP can lead to incredible new applications. Let's enter the *twilight zone* (no worries the ninja cat is with us) between SAP and Microsoft and see what's up here:
