# Episode 155: myNewsWrap ‚Äì Microsoft, GitHub and SAP

Welcome to this week's edition of myNewsWrap, news from the world of Microsoft, GitHub, SAP ... and the world in between. The focus of my newsletter is the *application development* and all things around that can improve our lives as developers.

Let's dive into the news and explore what came up this week that can help us to build better solutions for our customers.

## Microsoft Universe

First we take a look at the Microsoft universe and what crossed my path there.

### Serverless - Functions, SWA and Azure Container Apps

Apps need to run somewhere and a very convenient way to run them is *serverless*. What came up this week in this space?

#### Azure Functions and Static Web Apps (SWA)

* [Java on Azure Functions ‚Äì 2023 Updates | Azure Functions Community Standup](https://www.youtube.com/live/-8DKheQF1BE?si=q3s4-a-ZmnWSTZxb)
* [Top 10 Azure Functions Anti-Patterns](https://tsuyoshiushio.medium.com/top-10-azure-functions-anti-patterns-690ccff04a58) by Tsuyoshi Ushio

#### Azure Container Apps

* [Ask the Expert: Build Intelligent Microservices with Azure Container Apps](https://www.youtube.com/live/8HsNpCkYV5o?si=XC3ocItIY_xrsXl8)

### Dapr

Having containers is nice but everything (well ... nearly everything üòâ) gets better with [Dapr](https://dapr.io/) as an outstanding tool for app development in the container-based area. Here we go what might be worth a look:

* [Dapr Community Call - Oct 18th (#92)](https://youtu.be/uQHxsPCxbFk?si=ym9ch1B9GqHgg7q3)
* [Dapr v1.12 Release Highlights](https://www.diagrid.io/blog/dapr-v1-12-release-highlights) by Marc Duiker
* [Cloud-Native Local Development with Testcontainers and Dapr](https://www.diagrid.io/blog/cloud-native-local-development) by Mauricio Salatino
* [Dive into Event-Driven Architecture with Dapr](https://www.iamachs.com/p/dive-into-event-driven-architecture-with-dapr/) by Ahmed Muhi

### Developer Platform

This section collects all news touching the topic of a *developer platform*. Fuzzy term but here you find news on topics that make the life of developers easier beyond pure development be it *Infrastructure as Code*, *GitHub* and more like the [Azure Developer CLI](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev).  

#### Infrastructure as Code

* [Terraform on Azure](https://github.com/thomast1906/terraform-on-azure) by Thomas Thornton
* [How to use If-Else in Terraform](https://thomasthornton.cloud/2023/10/16/how-to-use-if-else-in-terraform/) by Thomas Thornton

#### GitHub

GitHub comes with a blast of new features and enhancements every week. Here are my top 3 news (not "5" as it was a bit more quiet this week) from GitHub that you should check out:

* [Measuring Git performance with OpenTelemetry](https://github.blog/2023-10-16-measuring-git-performance-with-opentelemetry/) by Jeff Hostetler
* [Code scanning with CodeQL supports Go 1.21](https://github.blog/changelog/2023-10-20-code-scanning-with-codeql-supports-go-1-21/) by
* [Your curated GitHub Universe agenda: AI, ethics, and productivity](https://github.blog/2023-10-17-your-curated-github-universe-agenda-ai-ethics-and-productivity/) by Ashley Willis

> Want to see all news around GitHub? I recommend to have a look at GitHub's [blog site](https://github.blog/) as well as at its [change log](https://github.blog/changelog/) to get the complete overview.

#### Azure Developer CLI

Close to my heart as essence of how to make the developer life easier is the [Azure Developer CLI](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev). What's up in this area?

* [The fastest way to go from local environment to cloud | Azd Community Standup](https://www.youtube.com/live/2Scg0zzbzkg?si=QkCRsLla3pkAQCNN)
* Dive into the azd code base: [AzureGreg chats with John Aziz about contributing to Open Source](https://www.youtube.com/live/zgoj8QK3UAM?si=W-M5sEw8a4k9JUtS) with John Aziz hosted by Gregor Suttie

### The best of the "rest"

No matter how the structure of this newsletter is crafted, there is always something that does not perfectly fit. This section is dedicated to topics that I think are worth reading but did not fit into the structure from above:

* [The Microsoft Azure Incubations Team launches Radius, a new open application platform for the cloud](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/the-microsoft-azure-incubations-team-launches-radius-a-new-open-application-platform-for-the-cloud?wt.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004195) by  Mark Russinovich - this looks really interesting!
* [Simplifying development experience and deployment with Azure Kubernetes Service extension in VS Code](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-infrastructure-blog/simplifying-development-experience-and-deployment-with-azure/ba-p/3932193?wt.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004195) by Tatsat Mishra

## üê±‚Äçüë§ SAP and Microsoft - Combining both worlds

No news from that area this week.

## Learning

One important (and imho best part) of the job of a developer is the *continuous learning*. Here are some interesting learning resources that go beyond vendor-specific technology:

* [Artificial Intelligence for Beginners - A Curriculum](https://microsoft.github.io/AI-For-Beginners/)
* Thoughtworks [Technology Radar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/content/dam/thoughtworks/documents/radar/2023/09/tr_technology_radar_vol_29_en.pdf)

### Golo's Corner

One great resource for becoming a better developer and reflecting about our profession is the high-quality content of [the native web GmbH](https://thenativeweb.io/) by [Golo Roden](https://twitter.com/goloroden). This week the following topics were on the list:

* [Mojo üî• ‚Äì DIE Sprache f√ºr KI // deutsch](https://youtu.be/5NdIq1nZmKM?si=79Fcryj9jPWWzkxW)

Make sure to subscribe to Golo's YouTube channels:

* [German channel](https://www.youtube.com/@thenativeweb)
* [English channel](https://www.youtube.com/@thenativeweb-en)

And Golo's personal channel with a new series - not IT, but about an important topic that is not too much talk about in the IT world:

* [Atomic Habits: Lohnt es sich? ‚Ä¶ (was ich von "Die 1%-Methode" von James Clear halte) // deutsch](https://youtu.be/mOdzOPxKick?si=UJ69j_TSWEvXAR9J)

### Events

And last but not least heads up for these upcoming events:

* [INNOQ Technology Day 2023](https://technologyday.innoq.com/) happening on November 13th

**And with this enjoy your weekend and have a successful next week!**
