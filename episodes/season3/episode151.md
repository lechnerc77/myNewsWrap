# Episode 151: myNewsWrap ‚Äì Microsoft, GitHub and SAP

Welcome to this week's edition of myNewsWrap, news from the world of Microsoft, GitHub, SAP ... and the world in between. The focus of my newsletter is the *application development* and all things around that can improve our lives as developers.

Let's dive into the news and explore what came up this week that can help us to build better solutions for our customers.

## Microsoft Universe

First we take a look at the Microsoft universe and what crossed my path there.

### Serverless - Functions, SWA and Azure Container Apps

Apps need to run somewhere and a very convenient way to run them is *serverless*. What came up this week in this space?

#### Azure Functions and Static Web Apps (SWA)

* [Azure Functions Community Standup - .NET announcements for Azure Functions](https://www.youtube.com/live/o9NnJdxHv1c?si=jwNNnC88F1fNDSx5)

### Dapr

Having containers is nice but everything (well ... nearly everything üòâ) gets better with [Dapr](https://dapr.io/) as an outstanding tool for app development in the container-based area. Here we go what might be worth a look:

* [Dapr as the Ultimate Microservices Patterns Framework](https://www.diagrid.io/blog/dapr-as-the-ultimate-microservices-patterns-framework) by Bilgin Ibryam
* [WebAssembly, Docker container, Dapr, and Kubernetes better together Series' Articles](https://dev.to/thangchung/series/24617) by Thang Chung

### Developer Platform

This section collects all news touching the topic of a *developer platform*. Fuzzy term but here you find news on topics that make the life of developers easier beyond pure development be it *Infrastructure as Code*, *GitHub* and more like the [Azure Developer CLI](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev).  

#### Infrastructure as Code

* [Terraform Basics: Core Workflow](https://youtu.be/sqLD39xqcx0?si=1Ne-jV7G-j8x-LXb) by Ned Bellavance
* [IaC Live Stream - September 2023](https://www.youtube.com/live/p0vDydkUWB4?si=eTx91ckwVHNr08U8) hosted by Ned Bellavance
* [Linux Foundation Launches OpenTofu: A New Open Source Alternative to Terraform](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press/announcing-opentofu)

#### GitHub

GitHub comes with a blast of new features and enhancements every week. Here are my top 5 news from GitHub that you should check out:

* [GitHub Copilot Chat beta now available for all individuals](https://github.blog/2023-09-20-github-copilot-chat-beta-now-available-for-all-individuals/) by Shuyin Zhao
* [Announcing general availability of GitHub Advanced Security for Azure DevOps](https://github.blog/2023-09-20-announcing-general-availability-of-github-advanced-security-for-azure-devops/) by Walker Chabbott

> Want to see all news around GitHub? I recommend to have a look at GitHub's [blog site](https://github.blog/) as well as at its [change log](https://github.blog/changelog/) to get the complete overview.

#### Azure Developer CLI

Close to my heart as essence of how to make the developer life easier is the [Azure Developer CLI](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev). What's up in this area?

* [Azd Community Standup - Azure Just Got Easier: A First Look at Simplified App Initialization](https://www.youtube.com/live/K8uwp2HmnYs?si=Xu4_2_-wz8gZW8Gq)
* [Speedrun your deployments from VS Code](https://www.youtube.com/live/yu4q-iLMtKA?si=YnQfBQORqcJoADsl) with Savannah Ostrowski

### The best of the "rest"

No matter how the structure of this newsletter is crafted, there is always something that does not perfectly fit. This section is dedicated to topics that I think are worth reading but did not fit into the structure from above:

* [Scaling Kubernetes to 7,500 nodes](https://openai.com/research/scaling-kubernetes-to-7500-nodes)
* [Announcing Microsoft Copilot, your everyday AI companion](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/09/21/announcing-microsoft-copilot-your-everyday-ai-companion/) by Yusuf Mehdi
* [TypeScript Origins: The Documentary](https://youtu.be/U6s2pdxebSo?si=25TFlrUrJmXKJUIz)

## üê±‚Äçüë§ SAP and Microsoft - Combining both worlds

Combining Microsoft with SAP can lead to incredible new applications. Let's enter the *twilight zone* (no worries the ninja cat is with us) between SAP and Microsoft and see what's up here:

* [SAP on Azure Video Podcast #161 - The one with even more Teams, SAP and AI (Chan Jin Park)](https://youtu.be/aBcb9goI1VM?si=KIsCZSCi0f-e5A0U)

> And of course a channel that you should subscribe to if you are working with SAP and Microsoft is the [SAP on Azure](https://www.youtube.com/@SAPonAzure) hosted by [Holger Bruchelt](https://www.linkedin.com/in/holger-bruchelt/) and friends.

### Further news from the SAP world

Let's check out what else happened in the SAP universe that you should check out - this week of course the DSAG annual conference in the spotlight:

## Learning

One important (and imho best part) of the job of a developer is the *continuous learning*. Here are some interesting learning resources that go beyond vendor-specific technology:

* [Let's #LearnLive: Deconstruct an Enterprise-Grade Serverless Architecture running on Azure](https://dev.to/azure/lets-learnlive-deconstruct-an-enterprise-grade-serverless-architecture-running-on-azure-52n8)
* [Fall For Intelligent Apps!](https://azure.github.io/Cloud-Native/Fall-For-IA/)

### Golo's Corner

One great resource for becoming a better developer and reflecting about our profession is the high-quality content of [the native web GmbH](https://thenativeweb.io/) by [Golo Roden](https://twitter.com/goloroden). This week the following topics were on the list:

* [Achtung: Mach nicht diesen Fehler (als Softwareentwicklerin oder -entwickler)! // deutsch](https://youtu.be/vWn3jxYR6oE?si=o12bYfScMWvZaBzX)

Make sure to subscribe to Golo's YouTube channels:

* [German channel](https://www.youtube.com/@thenativeweb)
* [English channel](https://www.youtube.com/@thenativeweb-en)

And Golo's personal channel with a new series - not IT, but about an important topic that is not too much talk about in the IT world:

* [Zeit, etwas zu ver√§ndern // deutsch](https://youtu.be/sVtBQnVB9sA?si=Y9xzzCeHAY9D6ToM)
* [Ich w√ºrde so gerne ‚Ä¶ (wie Du endlich Deine Ziele erreichst) // deutsch](https://youtu.be/Dpzf5g8iObY?si=LxmvTIodGgLlZqZj)

**And with this enjoy your weekend and have a successful next week!**
