# Episode 165: myNewsWrap ‚Äì Microsoft, GitHub and SAP

Welcome to this week's edition of myNewsWrap, news from the world of Microsoft, GitHub, SAP ... and the world in between. The focus of my newsletter is the *application development* and all things around that can improve our lives as developers.

Let's dive into the news and explore what came up this week that can help us to build better solutions for our customers.

## Microsoft Universe

First we take a look at the Microsoft universe and what crossed my path there.

### Serverless - Functions, SWA and Azure Container Apps

Apps need to run somewhere and a very convenient way to run them is *serverless*. What came up this week in this space?

#### Azure Container Apps

* [Azure Container Apps Community Standup - Cloud-native apps with .NET Aspire](https://www.youtube.com/live/FXZeKX8A_Gw?si=SCeMWgHKZaOyVleV)
* [Deploy apps to Azure Container Apps easily with .NET Aspire](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/deploy-apps-to-azure-container-apps-easily-with-net-aspire/ba-p/4032711) by JiachenJiang

### Dapr

Having containers is nice but everything (well ... nearly everything üòâ) gets better with [Dapr](https://dapr.io/) as an outstanding tool for app development in the container-based area. Here we go what might be worth a look:

* [Dapr Shared](https://github.com/dapr-sandbox/dapr-shared) - Dapr but without the sidecars
* Nice: [Contributing to Dapr Docs](https://youtu.be/uPYuXcaEs-c?si=Pn7YZEXuPlN7es54)

### Developer Platform

This section collects all news touching the topic of a *developer platform*. Fuzzy term but here you find news on topics that make the life of developers easier beyond pure development be it *Infrastructure as Code*, *GitHub* and more like the [Azure Developer CLI](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev).  

#### Infrastructure as Code

* [Terraform 1.7 adds test mocking and config-driven remove](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/terraform-1-7-adds-test-mocking-and-config-driven-remove)

#### GitHub

GitHub comes with a blast of new features and enhancements every week. Here are my top 5 news from GitHub that you should check out:

* [NEW GitHub Certifications | What are they](https://youtu.be/ljBauDyZm1k?si=u92wVtOJnPGXpvOE) by James Cook
* [GitHub Issues & Projects ‚Äì Project status updates & issues side panel](https://github.blog/changelog/2024-01-18-github-issues-projects-project-status-updates-issues-side-panel/)
* [GitHub Availability Report: December 2023](https://github.blog/2024-01-17-github-availability-report-december-2023/) by Jakub Oleksy
* [A developer‚Äôs second brain: Reducing complexity through partnership with AI](https://github.blog/2024-01-17-a-developers-second-brain-reducing-complexity-through-partnership-with-ai/) by Eirini Kalliamvakou
* [GitHub-hosted runners: Double the power for open source](https://github.blog/2024-01-17-github-hosted-runners-double-the-power-for-open-source/) by Larissa Fortuna

> Want to see all news around GitHub? I recommend to have a look at GitHub's [blog site](https://github.blog/) as well as at its [change log](https://github.blog/changelog/) to get the complete overview.

### The best of the "rest"

No matter how the structure of this newsletter is crafted, there is always something that does not perfectly fit. This section is dedicated to topics that I think are worth reading but did not fit into the structure from above:

* [Introducing the Radius feature roadmap](https://blog.radapp.io/posts/2024/01/12/introducing-the-radius-feature-roadmap/)
* [Container Image Security Part 1: Azure Container Registry](https://www.wesleyhaakman.org/container-image-security-part-1-azure-container-registry/) and [Container Image Security Part 2: Building & The pipeline](https://www.wesleyhaakman.org/container-image-security-part-2-building-the-pipeline/) by Wesley Haakman

## üê±‚Äçüë§ SAP and Microsoft - Combining both worlds

Combining Microsoft with SAP can lead to incredible new applications. Let's enter the *twilight zone* (no worries the ninja cat is with us) between SAP and Microsoft and see what's up here:

* [SAP on Azure Video Podcast #175 - The one with moving to Flexible Virtual Machine Scale Set (Goran Condric)](https://youtu.be/vtZiyu4GdKI?si=rDHO5hokf059gHZ1)

> And of course a channel that you should subscribe to if you are working with SAP and Microsoft is the [SAP on Azure](https://www.youtube.com/@SAPonAzure) hosted by [Holger Bruchelt](https://www.linkedin.com/in/holger-bruchelt/) and friends.

## Learning

One important (and imho best part) of the job of a developer is the *continuous learning*. Here are some interesting learning resources that go beyond vendor-specific technology:

* [The Retry Pattern and Retry Storm Anti-pattern](https://www.willvelida.com/posts/retries-and-retry-storm/) by Will Velida - also check out his [blog](https://www.willvelida.com/posts/) as he published further nice patterns this week!

### Golo's Corner

One great resource for becoming a better developer and reflecting about our profession is the high-quality content of [the native web GmbH](https://thenativeweb.io/) by [Golo Roden](https://twitter.com/goloroden). This week the following topics were on the list:

* [Vanilla Web: Der Frontend-Trend f√ºr 2024? // deutsch](https://youtu.be/cttpgBg6pDQ?si=mH-cujOzHKo9YbkP)

Make sure to subscribe to Golo's YouTube channels:
